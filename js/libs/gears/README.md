_Gears.d3.js_ is a [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) example for creating simulated gear animations with SVG.

Here you can see the [demo](http://brm.io/gears-d3-demo/)

## Usage ##

See the included `index.html` for example usage, or see the [demo](http://brm.io/gears-d3-demo/)

## What's all this then ##

I made this as an animation for my site's home page, where you can also [see it](http://brm.io/) in action. 
It's based on this more limited [example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1353700) by mbostock.

I improved it by adding a (basic) simulation of the gears, where power is actually trasmitted. 
The gears also can be dragged around and will automatically mesh correctly when they get close.
